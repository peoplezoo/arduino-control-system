Arduino Control System
Overview
The Arduino Control System is an avant-garde project that amalgamates sophisticated technologies such as voice recognition, enhanced object detection, gesture control, data logging, and remote monitoring. This system leverages an Arduino microcontroller to orchestrate a myriad of functions, thereby offering a comprehensive solution for both autonomous and manual control paradigms.

Features
Voice Control
Harnessing the capabilities of contemporary natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, this feature enables the system to interpret and execute vocal commands with precision, facilitating a seamless and hands-free interaction model.

Enhanced Object Recognition
Integrating state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as YOLOv5 and MobileNet, the system exhibits unparalleled precision in object detection and classification. This functionality is pivotal for applications requiring meticulous object recognition and real-time engagement.

Gesture Control
Employing advanced computer vision techniques, specifically utilizing the MediaPipe framework, the system discerns and processes intricate hand gestures. This feature allows for an intuitive and natural user interface, leveraging spatial and motion tracking algorithms.

Data Logging and Analysis
A robust data logging mechanism is implemented using SQLite, ensuring comprehensive storage and retrieval of sensor data and system events. These data logs can be queried and visualized using matplotlib, facilitating in-depth data analysis and optimization through temporal and statistical methods.

Remote Control and Monitoring 
A web-based interface, developed with Flask and enhanced with real-time communication capabilities via Socket.IO, empowers users to remotely control and monitor the system. This interface provides instantaneous feedback and command execution, leveraging WebSocket protocols for enhanced interactivity and low-latency communication.

Setup
Prerequisites
